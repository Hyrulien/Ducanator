## Requirements

### For Development

- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter 

## Installation

### Option 1: Use the Executable (Recommended)

1. Download `Ducanator.rar` from `releases` 
2. Run `WarframeInventoryOverlay.exe`
3. Click "Reload JSON" to load your inventory make sure Warframe is running during this processs, this takes about 7secs, click this button everytime theres changes in your inventory i.e you bought/sold/gained new items to populate the overlay with the new data. If an error occurs saying Request failed, just try again.

### Option 2: Run from Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
3. No additional packages required
4. Run: `python main.py`

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Generate Inventory Data**:
   - Click "🔄 Reload JSON" button
   - This runs `warframe-api-helper.exe` to generate `inventory.json`
   - Wait ~7 seconds for automatic refresh

2. **Load Category Files**:
   - Place JSON files in `cachedData/` folder:
     - `Warframes.json`
     - `Primary.json`
     - `Secondary.json`
     - `Melee.json`
     - `Sentinels.json`
     - `SentinelWeapons.json`
     - `Arch-Gun.json`
     - `Arch-Melee.json`
     - `Archwing.json`

### Managing Items

- **Mark Items**: Right-click any item to mark it (excludes from trade calculations and acts as a visual for items you do not want to sell/keep for later)
- **Mark Entire Set**: Right-click the separator row (e.g., "--- Afuris Prime ---") to mark all components and exclude them from the calculations
- **Hide Marked**: Click "👁 Hide Marked" to toggle visibility of marked items
- **Clear Marks**: Click "🗑 Clear All Marks" to remove all marks

### Filters

- **Search**: Filter by Item Name
- **Ducat Filter**: Enter a ducat value (15, 25, 45, 65, 100) to show items only with said ducat values.
- **Platinum Filter**: Enter a minimum platinum value to auto-mark high-value items and exclude them from the calculation. e.g if you type 15, all items priced 15 plat and higher will get marked and excluded.
- **Category**: Click category buttons to filter by (Quantity & Platinum)
- **Clear**: Click "Clear" to reset all filters

### Price Management

- **Auto-Fetch**: Prices are automatically fetched when inventory loads
- **Manual Fetch**: Click "💰 Fetch Prices" to refresh all prices
- **Price Cache**: Prices are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Sort by Price**: Click the Platinum/Quantity column headers to sort (normal → ascending → descending)


## How It Works

1. **Inventory Loading**: Reads `inventory.json` generated by `warframe-api-helper.exe`
2. **Prime Filtering**: Extracts only Prime items from category JSON files
3. **Component Matching**: Matches Prime components to your inventory quantities
4. **Price Fetching**: Queries Warframe Market API for platinum prices (rate-limited to 3 req/sec)
5. **Price Calculation**: Filters out scam prices (1plat orders on expensive stuff for example) using median-based algorithm
6. **Trade Calculation**: Counts unmarked items to calculate full trades (for ducat selling)

## Troubleshooting

### "inventory.json not found"
- Click "🔄 Reload JSON" to generate it
- Ensure `warframe-api-helper.exe` is in `cachedData/` folder

### Prices Not Loading
- Check internet connection
- Click "💰 Fetch Prices" to manually refresh
- Prices are cached for 1 hour - wait or force refresh

### Executable Not Working
- Ensure Windows 7 or later
- May need Visual C++ Redistributables 
- Some antivirus may flag it (false positive - add exception)

## Notes

- **Marked Items**: Saved in `marked_items.json` and persist between sessions
- **Price Cache**: Stored in `cachedData/price_cache.json` (1 hour expiry)
- **Price Fluctuation** Do not rely on the platinum prices listed even if you manually refetch there can be discrepancies between what the API call fetches and whats actually available on WFM. To be sure, double check high value items yourself on WFM.
- **Will I get banned for using this?** As with any 3rd Party application, caution is advised and I won't be held responsible for any account infringements or penalties that may incur from using this program, however my program does not tamper with any warframe files or inject itself into the game hence why you should be fine using this.
